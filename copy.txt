The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get
closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from 
the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on 500 cities. 

After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plut various aspects 
of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we evaluated included the following: temperature, 
cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and 
visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and 
brief descriptions of any identifiable trends or correlations.
