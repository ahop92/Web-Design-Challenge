# HTML Deployment of Global Weather Analysis

## Background

The purpose of this assignement was to practice deploying data analysis and visualizations to website. Using OpenWeather API data and visualizations from a previous assignment, a multi-page website was created. 

## Basic Operation 

The website operated using the following dynamics: 

1. A landing page containing an explanation of the project and links to each of the visualization pages either in the form of thumbnails or as options in a size adaptable navbar.
2. Four visualization pages (Latitdude vs. Cloudiness, Max Temp, Humidity, and Wind Speed) that offer a brief explanation of the data visualized as well as the links mentioned in #1. 
3. A comparisons page that offers larger thumbnails of each graph so that the user can easily compare with all of the images together. This page also contained the dynamics mentioned in #1
4. A data page that shows the table of data used to generate the visualizations. The data table was created using a jupyter notebook that converted the CSV form of the data into and HTML script. This page also contained the dynamics mentioned in #1


## IO Deployment 

As requested, the results of the work can be seen on a Github hosted platform so that users can access the webpage from the internet rather than needing to deploy it locally. Please travel to https://ahop92.github.io
to see the live website.
